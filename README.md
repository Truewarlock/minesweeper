# Introduction

This is my take on the classic Minesweeper game that I never understood as a child, but that I grew to like as an adult. 

The app is made using the Angular framework and everything here was done from scratch by me (even the icons, no Chat GPT or stackoverflow help). 

This project was meant as an example for my students and junior programers.
